## Coordinated Disclosure

### Timeline

We follow a **90-day disclosure timeline**:

- **Day 90:** You may publicly disclose

### Extensions

We may request an extension if:
- The fix requires significant architectural changes
- Coordination with third parties is needed
- The fix is in testing and almost ready

We will always explain why and propose a new timeline.
